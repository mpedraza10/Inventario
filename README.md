# Inventario
School project of an inventory in terminal made in Python 

In this project weÂ´ve created a great inventory with different options, we included a menu were you can decide what to do, this included the option to register
sells, register new articles to the inventory, generate reports about the salesmen, and many more. 
We were able to use different topics like matrix, functions, condicional, cycles, and also we read external files to get our inventory and sells. I hope to keep
adding more features and one day give it an interface.

INSTRUCTIONS: To use it you need to enter two files, one will be the inventory and the other the sells report with all of the salesmen, I included two files that
you can use or generate your own based on the files as an example. Enjoy!
